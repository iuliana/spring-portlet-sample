This is a sample web application that contains JSR 168 portlets developed
using the Spring Portlet MVC framework.

BUILDING

You will need a fully functional Java 5 (or later) JDK and Maven 2 environment
(see http://maven.apache.org/) in order to build this project from source.

To build a deployable portlet application war file, simply run the command:

	mvn clean package

The resulting war file will be in the "target" directory.

The build process will automatically preconfigure the war file to run in a
Pluto 1.1 portlet container.  If you are deploying to a different environment,
you will want to strip out the 'maven-pluto-plugin' entry in the plugins
section of the pom.xml file, and follow the instructions for your target
portlet container.

DEPLOYING

Maven is capable of automatically deploying this webapp to a target
application server by using the 'cargo' plugin.  Please look at the
'cargo-maven2-plugin' entry in the plugins section of the pom.xml file for
the configuration.

Once properly configured, the webapp can be completely built and deployed
using the command:

	mvn clean package cargo:redeploy

The target application server does need to be up and running for this work
properly.

COMPATIBILITY

This sample application uses Java 5 features and is intended for a container
that supports Servlet 2.4 and JSP 2.0, such as Tomcat 5.5.  It has not been
tested extensively with any other servlet containers.

There are a number of required libraries that get included in the WEB-INF/lib
directory of this webapp.  Be aware that having duplicate libraries in any of
the other class-loaders can create serious problems.  Depending on your portal,
you may well already have some of these libraries in a shared class-loader.  Be
sure to move/delete any duplicate libraries out of this webapp or bad things
may happen.
